SQL Views: A Short Overview
A view in SQL is a virtual table that consists of the results of a SELECT query. It does not store data physically but allows users to simplify complex queries by abstracting them into reusable SQL queries.

Key Points about Views:
Definition: A view is defined by a SELECT query that pulls data from one or more tables.
Virtual Table: Views do not store data but rather provide a dynamic result set each time the view is queried.
Usage:
Simplifies complex queries by creating a reusable SQL statement.
Provides an extra layer of security by restricting access to specific columns or rows in underlying tables.
Can be used to present data in a more user-friendly format.
Advantages of Views:
Simplifies Querying: Abstracts away the complexity of joins and aggregations.
Reusability: Can be reused across multiple queries to ensure consistency.
Security: Limits access to sensitive data by exposing only necessary columns.
Limitations:
Performance: Views donâ€™t improve performance inherently; querying complex views can be slower, especially with large datasets.
Not Always Updatable: Some views (especially those with joins or aggregations) cannot be directly updated.
**Creating a View:**
CREATE VIEW view_name AS 
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
**Example**
CREATE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_name 
FROM employees 
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
